# <h2>LARPWORKS: Project Cyaniel</h2>

<h2>LARP Manager Application</h2>

<h3>Setting up a Working Dev Environment</h3>

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Get access added by contacting Scott Spalding.
3. Clone the repo from this page: https://github.com/LARPWorks/csharp_cyaniel .  If you're a novice, you should probably do it in a tool like SourceTree.
4. Open the project (.sln file) in Visual Studio.
5. Make sure the compiler is in "Debug" mode, and run the project.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/

<h3>Development Guidelines</h3>
1. New features should go into feature branches.</br>
   `It's acceptable to just make a branch with your username for development.`
2. Master branch is reserved for releases. Usually at milestone completion stages.</br>
   `Development branch is for active development.`</br>
   `Pull requests on feature branches go to development.`
